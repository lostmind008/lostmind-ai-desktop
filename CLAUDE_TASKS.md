# CLAUDE_TASKS.md for LostMindAI Desktop Enhancement

## Current Tasks

### Phase 1: Backend API Foundation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] T16: Create comprehensive enhancement documentation and roadmap (files: ENHANCEMENT_ROADMAP.md) (Status: Completed) (Next Action: Begin Phase 1 implementation with API-first architecture)
- [ ] T17: Create FastAPI Backend Service (files: backend/app/main.py, backend/app/api/, backend/app/core/config.py) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Setup FastAPI application with OpenAPI documentation and WebSocket support)
- [ ] T18: Migrate Gemini Logic to Backend Services (files: backend/app/services/gemini_service.py, backend/app/api/endpoints/chat.py) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Extract current Gemini logic into API services with unified client pattern)
- [ ] T19: Implement Backend Caching & Vector Database (files: backend/app/services/cache_service.py, backend/app/services/vector_service.py) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Setup Redis caching and SQLite vector database with API endpoints)

### Phase 2: Client Development (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] T20: Refactor Desktop Client for API Communication (files: desktop-client/src/api_client/backend_client.py, desktop-client/src/services/local_server.py) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Create API client and migrate PyQt6 UI to communicate with backend service)
- [ ] T21: Create Web Client Foundation (files: web-client/src/components/ChatInterface.vue, web-client/src/services/api.js) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Setup Vue.js web application with real-time chat and responsive design)
- [ ] T22: Add Advanced Backend Features (files: backend/app/services/rag_service.py, backend/app/api/endpoints/knowledge.py) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Implement RAG pipeline, knowledge management API, and thinking budget system)

### Phase 3: Production & Advanced Features (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] T23: Production Deployment Setup (files: docker-compose.yml, backend/Dockerfile, deploy/nginx.conf) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Setup Docker containerization and deployment infrastructure)
- [ ] T24: Advanced AI Features (files: backend/app/services/graph_service.py, backend/app/agents/rag_agent.py) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Implement knowledge graphs, agentic capabilities, and web search fallback)
- [ ] T25: lostmindai.com Integration (files: web-client/public/manifest.json, deploy/lostmindai-integration.md) (Status: Pending) (Next Action: Deploy web client to lostmindai.com with SSL and user authentication)

## Current Debug Session
**Issue**: Planning comprehensive enhancement of PyQt6 application with enterprise RAG capabilities
**Symptoms**: 
- Current application has basic genai SDK usage without advanced patterns
- No persistent context or knowledge management
- Missing cost optimization and caching
- Limited conversation intelligence

**Hypothesis**: Integrating proven patterns from other LostMindAI projects will create enterprise-grade assistant
**Attempted solutions**:
1. Analyzed advanced features across all projects - Result: Identified 5 key enhancement areas
2. Created comprehensive roadmap - Result: Phased approach with clear priorities
3. Documented technical architecture - Result: Ready for implementation

**Next steps for debugging**: Begin Phase 1 implementation with unified client upgrade

## Project State
**Current architectural state**: Basic PyQt6 application with standard genai SDK usage, good UI foundation, professional branding
**Recent significant changes**: 
- Added Gemini 2.5 Pro support
- Repository restructured and properly branded
- Comprehensive enhancement roadmap created

**API/Service dependencies**: 
- Google GenAI SDK (to be upgraded to unified client)
- Vertex AI (current authentication working)
- Future: Vector database, caching service, knowledge management

**Environment configurations**: 
- Development environment ready
- Google Cloud authentication configured
- Ready for enhanced dependencies installation

## Recent Decisions Log
- May 26, 2025 @ 4:59 AM: Decided on phased implementation approach starting with unified client upgrade
- May 26, 2025 @ 4:45 AM: Identified 5 key enhancement areas from analysis of other projects
- May 26, 2025 @ 4:30 AM: Chose enterprise RAG as primary enhancement focus

## Notes & Open Questions
- Should we implement local-first vector storage or cloud-based for Phase 1?
- Which embedding model provides best balance of performance and cost for knowledge base?
- How to handle migration of existing conversations to new enhanced system?
- Integration strategy for morphic-core knowledge graph patterns?
- Timeline for user testing and feedback collection during enhancement phases?
